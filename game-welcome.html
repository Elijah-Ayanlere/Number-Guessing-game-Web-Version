            <h1>Important Notice!</h1>
            <p>
                <b>Welcome, <span id="playerName"></span>! Thank you for joining the Unique Number Guessing Game. Get ready for an exciting challenge!</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>In this game, your mission is to guess a number randomly chosen within a specific range. But here's the twist - each round comes with a mysterious modifier that adds an extra layer of intrigue!</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Let's break it down: when you make a guess and it's correct, the game reveals not only the base number you guessed but also a mysterious modifier. The base number plus the modifier gives you the final result. For example, if you guess 85 and the game says it's correct with a modifier of 6, the actual target number is 91 (85 + 6).</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>This mysterious modifier adds unpredictability and excitement to each round. It's like a hidden factor that influences the outcome, making each guess an adventure!</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>If you're feeling up for an extra challenge, there's also the Wildcard Round where you can earn bonus points. And don't forget about the Hint Coin - your magical tool for getting hints when needed.</b>
